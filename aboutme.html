<p style="color:	#800080;"> I like to play basketball and draw. I enjoy the club, Arrow Soul in my school were we paint, and spray paint on local walls in our community or in school.

<p style="font-size:190%">Fun Fact:</p>

<p style="color: 			#800080;"> I've gone to Michigan by car and traveled across so many states on my way there and back. The best part about Michigan were all the wonderful lakes and being able to see the bridge you can take to go to Canada from Detroit, Michigan. </p>
